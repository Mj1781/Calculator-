# Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator program implemented in C++, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program utilizes a menu-based system and switch statements to process user input and perform the desired operations.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable generated.

## Functionality

The calculator supports the following operations:

- Addition: Calculates the sum of two numbers.
- Subtraction: Computes the difference between two numbers.
- Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers together.
- Division: Divides one number by another.

Upon running the program, a menu will be displayed with the available operations. Enter the corresponding choice number (1, 2, 3, or 4) to perform the desired operation. The calculator will prompt you to enter the numbers for the chosen operation and display the result accordingly. If the operation is division and the second number is 0, a message will indicate that division by zero is not allowed.

To exit the program, select option 5 from the menu.
